ie.manual.entry.distillationTower.name=Distillation Tower
ie.manual.entry.distillationTower.subtext=Environmentally unfriendly
ie.manual.entry.distillationTower0=The Distillation Tower is a large multiblock structure that separates crude oil into a number of byproducts. It is built as shown and formed by using the Engineering's Hammer on the Redstone Engineering Block.<br><br>Crude Oil can be input into the Distillation Tower at the back hatch marked with a blue dot, where it will be heated until it separates into a number of layers. This produces Diesel fuel and has a chance to produce Bitumen as a byproduct.
ie.manual.entry.distillationTower1=The Distillation Tower uses <config;i;distillationTower_operationCost> Flux per operation, converting up to 25 mB of Crude Oil to Diesel per tick. The produced Diesel is output from the side hatch marked with an orange dot; the Bitumen through the front hatch. These outputs can be used for <link;dieselgen;§o§npower §o§nproduction§r> and <link;asphalt;§o§nasphalt§r>, respectively.<br><br>Applying a redstone signal to the control panel at the front will halt the machine's process, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Engineer's Hammer.

ie.manual.entry.pumpjack0=The Pumpjack is a multiblock that extracts Crude Oil from deposits situated underneath bedrock. The structure is formed by using the Engineering's Hammer on the Heavy Engineering Block on the second layer.
ie.manual.entry.pumpjack1=The Pumpjack Tower uses <config;i;pumpjack_consumption> Flux/t to pump Crude Oil at a rate of <config;i;pumpjack_speed> mB/t. The produced oil is automatically ejected through the two side ports with orange dots.<br><br>The average Oil deposit will take <config;i;pumpjack_days> days to deplete, though adding more Pumpjacks can speed the process.<br><br>Applying a redstone signal to the control panel will halt the machine's process, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Engineer's Hammer.

ie.manual.entry.oil.subtext=Black gold
ie.manual.entry.oil0=While mining near bedrock, you've occasionally noticed a slick black flammable substance: oil. Oil is just one of many fluids that can be found underneath the impenetrable rock, but you won't be able to breach these reserves on your own.<br><br>With the help of a <link;pumpjack;§o§nspecially §o§ndesigned §o§nmachine§r> you may be able to get your hands on the contents of these reservoirs.
ie.manual.entry.oil1=The <link;minerals;§o§nCore §o§nSample §o§nDrill§r> will determine whether a reservoir can be found in a specific chunk and gives insight into the size of the fluid deposit.<br><br>Despite the finite volume of fluid in each chunk, certain types of reservoirs may have trace amounts of fluid that can still be harvested after the chunk is depleted. Using more than one Pumpjack in a depleted chunk does not provide any benefit.

ie.manual.entry.schematics.name=Multiblock Projector
ie.manual.entry.schematics.subtext=Invaluable instructions
ie.manual.entry.schematics0=When it comes to building large multiblock structures, referring to your Engineer's Manual time and time again has grown tedious. By crafting a primitive projector device, you believe you can project schematics of these structures into the world to use as a template.
ie.manual.entry.schematics1=If you turn your Engineer's Manual to the page of a multiblock structure and then place it in a crafting bench alongside a Projector, you can set the internal slide to match that multiblock. The Projector will then act as a three dimensional building guide.
ie.manual.entry.schematics2=Holding a Projector will display the structure. Pressing the pick block button will rotate the structure, and sneaking while doing so will mirror it. Right clicking will lock the image in place, where it will show as long as the Projector is in your hotbar.<br><br>Sneaking and right clicking with a projector that has a locked image will unlock the image.<br><br>In Creative mode, sneaking while locking the image will build the multiblock automatically.
